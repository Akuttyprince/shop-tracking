bro thala ajith is also my hero but here i mentioned tonystrak the ironman.. i am creating this as a non profitable one because then only everyone can use it like open socurec but ur saying whatsApp/sms need paid services for real implementation. is there any option. in data recovery there is no issuse bro better we can add like this we only storing the information not the history so the duplicates will became minimum and if need means we can add recent history with current cridet. its ok for me to use json instread of mangoDB bro.. bro as i said i need a opensource for drive ,whatsapp , sms etc . if there is no other option means tell me what to do remove it or find alternative solution. and in customer history ad default we can keep show last 5 history entries. but need an arrow to show full history. aditional ideas i dont need a reset demo i can manually create using our app. yep yes we can add dark mode in it. yep yes we can also add multi-language: yep ya we can do analytics widget indeep also . bro i am not making it for hackathon i make it to show demo to my teachers , friends, and some shopkeepers near me to get an  idea about it work or not in the partically world..
