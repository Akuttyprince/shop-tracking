i know that clicking whatsapp button manually . there is no issues because for just not clicking they have to pay . so its ok and also set the default msg in whatsapp from localstroage. if sms is not free means we can go with mail instread and i am building a full woring model so dont add alter option as a block to cover the page. find is there any other way to send them messege for every transaction, without clicking manually- anything is ok for me like telegram, email,etc. yep its ok for me to use file system api to save csv and also make a full pdf download also or make as excel sheet. better we can give a idea about how to upload it in the drive. 1 ruppes for sms is too high better we can find alter native source. yes in data recovery do the same and also add items in it because the old history they already have in the hand as pdf, csv ( if possible excel)
